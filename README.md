# Day-3-Self-Clinic
array binary search algorithm, find Missing test spec functions and test, a simple UI

#How to Run the Program
Do run the tests differenty as a function in the binarysearch test affects the output of the findMissing function.
In place of npm test use 
jasmine spec/binarysearchtestspec.js and
jasmine spec/FindMissingtestspec.js

Firstly, you are to create three functions, as prototypes to the Array class to return the following:
>`toTwenty()` returns `[1, 2, 3 . . . 20]`
>`toForty()` returns `[2, 4, 6 . . . 40]`
>`toOneThousand()` returns `[10, 20, 30 . . . 1000]`
Once you are done, create another prototype(d) function called `.search`, it will take just one argument which is the number you are to find. The search function should return an object, which contains
>`.count`, the number of times your function iterated to find the index of the number in question
>`.index`, the index of the number in question
>`.length`, the length of the original array
The `.search` function should implement the *binary search algorithm*. Each time you iterate, you should increase the count, to test how efficient your implementation is.




*QUESTION 2:*
You are presented with two arrays, all containing positive integers. Create a function *findMissing(arr1, arr2)* that takes in two arguments, both of which are arrays. One of the arrays will have one extra number, see below:
>`[1,2,3]` and `[1,2,3,4]` should return `4`
>`[4,66,7]` and `[66,77,7,4]` should return `77`
